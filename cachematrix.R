## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your

## WThis function will creates an object that can cache it's inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## this function will compute the inverse of the above matrix x, and checks if the inverse has is available 
## from the cache. if it has, it will retrieve from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
## if matrix was changed and inverse is not in cache it will use this function to calculate the inverse
solve<- function(x,...){
}
